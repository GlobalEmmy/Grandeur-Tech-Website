              The popular notion on how tech is so technical and all is part of
              what brought about these free non-coding courses on Grandeur Tech.
              We believe spreading the gospel on these courses would help bridge
              the gender gap that exists in the tech industry. Many ladies are
              just as reluctant as you are to join the tech space because of
              this wrong notion. But no need to fear. You would fit right in.
              Not in all cases, technicality involved 🙂 Start by enrolling for

              As someone with a legal background, you already have the soft

              research, presentation and negotiation skills. You just need to
